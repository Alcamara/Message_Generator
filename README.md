<ol>
  <li>
    An overview of design decisions
    <ul>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    What language you picked and why?
    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript was the language I chose to use because I wanted to build the backend API with Express.js. Also, JavaScript is also a language I am very comfortable using.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What was your process for verifying the correctness of you program?
    <ul>
      <li>
      To test API routes, I use Postman.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What didn't you get to, or what else might you do with more time?
    <ul>
      <li>
        If I had more time, I would have done the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Written unit test using jest to ensure functions and API routes.</li>
          <li>Used Material UI to create more of a response layout.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
